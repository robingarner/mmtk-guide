\chapter{Mark-Sweep in MMTk}

\label{chap:mark-sweep}

\mmtk's implementation of mark-sweep is a highly optimized state-of-the-art
collector, and until recently its generational counterpart, GenMS, was the
default production collector.  The mark-sweep policy that underlies the
plan is used in every \mmtk\ collector since it is used for the non-moving and
code spaces common to all plans.

The basic idea is shared with McCarthey's 1960 collector~\citep{McCarthy:60}:
that the collector performs a transitive closure over the object graph marking 
live objects, and that all objects not marked are considered dead
at the end of the collection cycle.  We traditionally refer to marked objects as
being coloured black, and unmarked objects as white.
\begin{figure}
\begin{lstlisting}
/* 
 * Initially, all objects in the heap are coloured white.
 * white, gray and black are disjoint sets of objects
 */              
for (ref : root-set)
  if (ref != zero)
    gray.add(ref.load())

while (!gray.isEmpty())
  obj = gray.get();
  for (ref : obj.nonNullReferences())
    child = ref.load()
    if (child.isWhite())
      gray.add(child)
  black.add(obj)
/*
 * Now all objects are either black or white, white ones
 * are unreachable and can be freed.
 */
for (obj : white)
  obj.free()
\end{lstlisting}

\label{fig:ms:pseudo}

The pseudo-code in Figure~\ref{fig:ms:pseudo} illustrates the algorithm in terms
of the traditional tri-colour abstraction from \cite{DLM+:76}.  

As with all \mmtk\ plans, collection is performed in parallel, with a number of
collector threads running in parallel to mark the heap.

The abstract description in Figure~\ref{fig:ms:pseudo} requires that each object
can be assigned to one of three sets: white, black and gray.  Traditionally this
is implemented using a boolean flag per object (either stored in the object or
outside the heap).  If the flag is false, the object is white.  If the flag is
true, then either the object is gray or black.  The set of gray objects is
usually kept as a side data structure such as a stack or a
queue, since the purpose of the 'grey' state is as a list of work
still to be done\footnote{There are other more arcane implementations that can
thread the grey set through the heap.  This is generally only of interest in 
space-constrained LISP-like languages where most objects are only 2 words long.}.

\mmtk\ supports two implementations of the mark state, described in
Section~\ref{sec:ms:state}.  The mark-state is either stored in the header
of each object, or in a region reserved at the start of every 4MB chunk of
virtual address space.

One of the shortcomings of pure mark-sweep collectors is that they must traverse
the heap twice in each collection cycle, once to mark the reachable objects
(the mark phase), and then a second time to build the free list from the white
objects (the sweep phase).  
Black objects can also be marked white during the sweep phase, 
to initialize them ready for the next GC.
The sweep phase is particularly expensive because it requires visiting the
entire heap, not just the (hopefully much smaller) fraction that is in use.
\mmtk\ uses \emph{lazy sweeping} \citep{Hughes:82, Boehm:00} to ameliorate the
cost of sweeping.  The \mmtk\ implementation is described in detail below in
Section~\ref{sec:ms:lazy}.

\section{Segregated Free List}

For allocation, the mark-sweep policy uses a \emph{segregated free list}
allocator, also used by other policies such as reference counting.
The essential features of this allocation strategy are that 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The heap is divided into \emph{blocks} of multiples of 4KB in size.
  \item Blocks are tracked by a \lstinline|GenericFreeList|, a coalescing
  doubly-linked list of free blocks.  Blocks are only returned to the global
  free-list when, after collection, they contain no live objects.
  \item Each block is divided into \emph{cells} of one \emph{size class}.  The
  free cells in a block are arranged in a singly-linked list, kept in the first
  word of each cell.  Blocks are sized to ensure that at least 20 cells of the
  size class can fit into a block.
  \item The allocator defines ~20 fixed size classes.  
  \item Each thread maintains two arrays of addresses: a list of free cells in
  each size class, and a list of used blocks in each size class.
  \item The allocator maintains a list of the partially allocated blocks in each
  size class.
\end{enumerate}

The segregated free-list allocator contains thread-local and global classes,
called SegregatedFreeListLocal and SegregatedFreeListSpace respectively.  

\subsection{Allocation}

To illustrate the process of allocation, assume the following data structures:
\begin{itemize} % \lstinline||
  \item \lstinline|cells|, a thread-local array of \lstinline|Address|, pointing
  to the first free cell of each size class.
  \item \lstinline|usedBlocks|, a thread-local array of \lstinline|Address|,
  containing the head of a (per size-class) list of blocks allocated into by
  this thread since the last collection.
  \item \lstinline|freeBlocks|, a global array of \lstinline|Address|,
  containing the head of a (per size-class) list of blocks allocated into prior
  to the most recent collection.
\end{itemize}
We are implementing the function \lstinline|Address alloc(int bytes)|.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Determine the size-class of the allocation request. 
  \begin{lstlisting}
int sc = getSizeClass(bytes).
  \end{lstlisting}
  \item If \lstinline|cells[sc]| is non-zero (\ie\ there are free cells
  available), set the free-cell-list pointer to the next cell in the list, and
  return.
  \begin{lstlisting}
if (cells[sc] == 0) {
  // Allocate cells from the global pool
}
Address result = cells[sc];
cells[sc] = nextCell(result);
return result;
  \end{lstlisting}
  This comprises the fast-path of the free-list allocator, which satisfies
  around 95\% of all allocations.
  \item If the free cell list is empty, we request a block of free cells from
  the global space.  This looks first at the list of blocks already allocated to
  the size class.
    \begin{lstlisting}
Address block = 0;
synchronized {
  // Only one thread can access freeBlocks at a time
  block = freeBlocks[sc];
  if (freeBlocks[sc] != 0) {
    // Remove block from the head of the list
    freeBlocks[sc] = nextBlock(block);
  }
}
if (block == 0) {
  // Allocate fresh block
}
constructFreeList(block);     // Policy specific
cells[sc] = firstFreeCell(block);
usedBlocks[sc] = headInsert(block,usedBlocks[sc]);
return;
  \end{lstlisting}
  The method \lstinline|constructFreeList| varies according to the policy that
  uses the free list: an explicit free list policy inserts cells into the free
  list when they are freed, while mark-sweep with lazy sweeping reconstructs the
  free list based on the mark-state of each object in the block.
  \item The final case is where there are no blocks available in the global list
  for the size class.  In this case, a fresh block is acquired from the heap and
  divided into cells.
      \begin{lstlisting}
block = blockAllocator.alloc(blockSize(sc));
init(block,sc);
      \end{lstlisting}
  \end{enumerate} % \lstinline||

  If there are no free cells
of a given size class, a \emph{block} of 4-64KB is allocated and divided into
cells of the given size class.  Within a block, all cells are therefore of the
same size class, so as long as we know the size class of each
block, it is possible to locate each cell (and therefore each object) 
in the block.

The collector maintains a list per size-class of all blocks containing live
objects.  Each mutator maintains a list per size-class of the blocks it has
allocated into, and a pointer to the first free cell of each size class.
